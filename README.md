# Image View Extensions

<img align="right" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1567433/59150381-d34beb80-8a22-11e9-8d9a-6b1527ffc9e1.png" width="360"/>

Download and display an image in an image view with a single line of code:

```swift
Nuke.loadImage(with: url, into: imageView)
```

Nuke will check if the image exists in the memory cache, and if it does, will instantly display it. If not, the image data will be loaded, decoded, processed, and decompressed in the background.

> See [Image Pipeline Overview](#h_design) to learn more.

### In a List

When you request a new image for the existing view, Nuke will prepare it for reuse and cancel any outstanding requests for the view. Mangaging images in lists has never been easier.

```swift
func collectionView(_ collectionView: UICollectionView,
                    cellForItemAt indexPath: IndexPath)
                    -> UICollectionViewCell {
    Nuke.loadImage(with: url, into: cell.imageView)
}
```

> The requests also get canceled automatically when the views are deallocated. Call `Nuke.cancelRequest(for: imageView)` to cancel the request manually.

### Placeholders, Transitions, Content Modes

Use `ImageLoadingOptions` to set a `placeholder`, select one of the built-in `transitions`, or provide a custom one.

```swift
let options = ImageLoadingOptions(
    placeholder: UIImage(named: "placeholder"),
    transition: .fadeIn(duration: 0.33)
)
Nuke.loadImage(with: url, options: options, into: imageView)
```

You can even customize content modes per image type:

```swift
let options = ImageLoadingOptions(
    placeholder: UIImage(named: "placeholder"),
    failureImage: UIImage(named: "failureImage"),
    contentModes: .init(success: .scaleAspectFill, failure: .center, placeholder: .center)
)
```

> In case you want all image views to have the same behavior, you can modify `ImageLoadingOptions.shared`.

### `ImageRequest`

`ImageRequest` allows you to set image processors, change the request priority and more:

```swift
let request = ImageRequest(
    url: URL(string: "http://..."),
    processors: [ImageProcessor.Resize(size: imageView.bounds.size)],
    priority: .high
)
```

> Another way to apply processors is by setting the default `processors` on `ImagePipeline.Configuration`. These processors will be applied to all images loaded by the pipeline. If the request has a non-empty array of `processors`, they are going to be applied instead.

The advanced options available via `ImageRequestOptions`. For example, you can provide a `filteredURL` to be used as a key for caching in case the URL contains transient query parameters.

```swift
let request = ImageRequest(
    url: URL(string: "http://example.com/image.jpeg?token=123")!,
    options: ImageRequestOptions(
        filteredURL: "http://example.com/image.jpeg"
    )
)
```

> There are more options available, to see all of them check the inline documentation for `ImageRequestOptions`.

### SwiftUI

[`FetchImage`](https://github.com/kean/FetchImage) is a Swift package that makes it easy to download images using Nuke and display them in SwiftUI apps. For more info, see the [introductory post](https://kean.github.io/post/introducing-fetch-image). 

> **Note**: This is an API preview, it might change in the future.

```swift
public struct ImageView: View {
    @ObservedObject var image: FetchImage

    public var body: some View {
        ZStack {
            Rectangle().fill(Color.gray)
            image.view?
                .resizable()
                .aspectRatio(contentMode: .fill)
        }
    }
}
```

### Low Data Mode

[`FetchImage`](https://github.com/kean/FetchImage) also offers built-in support for low-data mode via a special initializer:

```swift
FetchImage(regularUrl: highQualityUrl, lowDataUrl: lowQualityUrl)
```

<br/>

# Image Processing

<img align="right" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1567433/59151404-cb944300-8a32-11e9-9c58-dbed9789080f.png" width="360"/>

Nuke features a powerful and efficient image processing infrastructure with multiple built-in processors including `ImageProcessor.Resize`, `.Circle`, `.RoundedCorners`, `.CoreImageFilter`, `.GaussianBlur`.

> This and other screenshots are from the demo project included in the repo.

### `Resize`

To resize an image, use `ImageProcessor.Resize`:

```swift
ImageRequest(url: url, processors: [
    ImageProcessor.Resize(size: imageView.bounds.size)
])
```

By default, the target size is in points. When the image is loaded, Nuke will scale it to fill the target area maintaining the aspect ratio. To crop the image set `crop` to `true`.

> There are a few other options available, see `ImageProcessor.Resize` documentation for more info.

### `GaussianBlur`, Core Image

`ImageProcessor.GaussianBlur` blurs the input image. It is powered by the native `CoreImage` framework. To apply other filters, use `ImageProcessor.CoreImageFilter`:

```swift
ImageProcessor.CoreImageFilter(name: "CISepiaTone")
```

> For a complete list of Core Image filters see [Core Image Filter Reference](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/GraphicsImaging/Reference/CoreImageFilterReference/index.html).

### Custom Processors

Custom processors need to conform to `ImageProcessing` protocol:

```swift
public protocol ImageProcessing {
    var identifier: String { get }
    var hashableIdentifier: AnyHashable { get }

    func process(image: Image, context: ImageProcessingContext?) -> Image?
}
```

The `process` method is self-explanatory. `identifier: String` is used by disk caches, and `hashableIdentifier: AnyHashable` is used by memory caches for which string manipulations would be too slow.

For one-off operations, use `ImageProcessor.Anonymous` to create a processor with a closure.

### Smart Decompression

When you instantiate `UIImage` with `Data`, the data can be in a compressed format like `JPEG`. `UIImage` does _not_ eagerly decompress this data until you display it. This leads to performance issues like scroll view stuttering. To avoid these it, Nuke automatically decompresses the data in the background. Decompression only runs if needed, it won't run for already processed images.

> See [Image and Graphics Best Practices](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2018/219) to learn more about image decoding and downsampling.

<br/>

# Image Pipeline

At the core of Nuke is the `ImagePipeline` class. Use the pipeline directly to load images without displaying them:

```swift
let task = ImagePipeline.shared.loadImage(
    with: url,
    progress: { _, completed, total in
        print("progress updated")
    },
    completion: { result: Result<ImageResponse, ImagePipeline.Error> in
        print("task completed")
    }
)
```

> To download the data without doing any expensive decoding or processing, use `loadData(with:progress:completion:)`.

### `ImageTask`

When you start the request, the pipeline returns an `ImageTask` object, which can be used for cancelation and more.

```swift
task.cancel()
task.priority = .high
```

### Customize Image Pipeline

If you want to build a system that fits your specific needs, you won't be disappointed. There are a _lot of things_ to tweak. You can set custom data loaders and caches, configure image encoders and decoders, change the number of concurrent operations for each individual stage, disable and enable features like deduplication and rate limiting, and more.

> To learn more see the inline documentation for `ImagePipeline.Configuration` and [Image Pipeline Overview](#h_design).

<img align="right" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1567433/59148462-94f60280-8a09-11e9-906a-6c7209b8f8c8.png" width="360"/>

Here are the protocols which can be used for customization:

- `DataLoading` – Download (or return cached) image data
- `DataCaching` – Store image data on disk
- `ImageDecoding` – Convert data into images
- `ImageEncoding` - Convert images into data
- `ImageProcessing` – Apply image transformations
- `ImageCaching` – Store images into a memory cache

The entire configuration is described by the `ImagePipeline.Configuration` struct. To create a pipeline with a custom configuration either call the `ImagePipeline(configuration:)` initializer or use the convenience one:

```swift
let pipeline = ImagePipeline {
    $0.dataLoader = ...
    $0.dataLoadingQueue = ...
    $0.imageCache = ...
    ...
}
```

And then set the new pipeline as default:

```swift
ImagePipeline.shared = pipeline
```

### Default Image Pipeline

The default image pipeline is initialized with the following dependencies:

```swift
// Shared image cache with a size limit of ~20% of available RAM.
imageCache = ImageCache.shared

// Data loader with a default `URLSessionConfiguration` and a custom `URLCache`
// with memory capacity 0, and disk capacity 150 MB.
dataLoader = DataLoader()

// Custom aggressive disk cache is disabled by default.
dataCache = nil

// By default uses the decoder from the global registry and the default encoder.
makeImageDecoder = { context in ImageDecoderRegistry.shared.decoder(for: context) }
makeImageEncoder = { _ in ImageEncoder() }
```

Each operation in the pipeline runs on a dedicated queue:

```swift
dataLoadingQueue.maxConcurrentOperationCount = 6
dataCachingQueue.maxConcurrentOperationCount = 2
imageDecodingQueue.maxConcurrentOperationCount = 1
imageEncodingQueue.maxConcurrentOperationCount = 1
imageProcessingQueue.maxConcurrentOperationCount = 2
imageDecompressingQueue.maxConcurrentOperationCount = 2
```

There is a list of pipeline settings which you can tweak:

```swift
// Automatically decompress images in the background by default.
isDecompressionEnabled = true

// Configure which images to store in the custom disk cache.
isDataCachingForOriginalImageDataEnabled = true
isDataCachingForProcessedImagesEnabled = false

// Avoid doing any duplicated work when loading or processing images.
isDeduplicationEnabled = true

// Rate limit the requests to prevent trashing of the subsystems.
isRateLimiterEnabled = true

// Progressive decoding is an opt-in feature because it is resource intensive.
isProgressiveDecodingEnabled = false

// If the data task is terminated (either because of a failure or a
// cancellation) and the image was partially loaded, the next load will
// resume where it was left off.
isResumableDataEnabled = true
```

And also a few global options shared between all pipelines:

```swift
ImagePipeline.Configuration.isAnimatedImageDataEnabled = false

// Enable to start using `os_signpost` to monitor the pipeline
// performance using Instruments.
ImagePipeline.Configuration.isSignpostLoggingEnabled = false
```

<br/>

# Caching

### LRU Memory Cache

Nuke's default `ImagePipeline` has two cache layers.

First, there is a memory cache for storing processed images which are ready for display.

```swift
// Configure cache
ImageCache.shared.costLimit = 1024 * 1024 * 100 // 100 MB
ImageCache.shared.countLimit = 100
ImageCache.shared.ttl = 120 // Invalidate image after 120 sec

// Read and write images
let request = ImageRequest(url: url)
ImageCache.shared[request] = image
let image = ImageCache.shared[request]

// Clear cache
ImageCache.shared.removeAll()
```

`ImageCache` uses the [LRU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cache_replacement_policies#Least_recently_used_(LRU)) algorithm – least recently used entries are removed first during the sweep.

### HTTP Disk Cache

Unprocessed image data is stored with `URLCache`.

```swift
// Configure cache
DataLoader.sharedUrlCache.diskCapacity = 100
DataLoader.sharedUrlCache.memoryCapacity = 0

// Read and write responses
let request = ImageRequest(url: url)
let _ = DataLoader.sharedUrlCache.cachedResponse(for: request.urlRequest)
DataLoader.sharedUrlCache.removeCachedResponse(for: request.urlRequest)

// Clear cache
DataLoader.sharedUrlCache.removeAllCachedResponses()
```

### Aggressive LRU Disk Cache

If HTTP caching is not your cup of tea, you can try using a custom LRU disk cache for fast and reliable *aggressive* data caching (ignores [HTTP cache control](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Cache-Control)). You can enable it using the pipeline configuration.

```swift
ImagePipeline {
    $0.dataCache = try! DataCache(name: "com.myapp.datacache")

    // Also consider disabling the native HTTP cache, see `DataLoader`.
}
```

By default, the pipeline stores only the original image data. To store the processed images enable `isDataCachingForProcessedImagesEnabled` and also consider disabling `isDataCachingForOriginalImageDataEnabled`. Every intermediate processed image will be stored in cache. So in the following scenario, there are going to be two entries in the disk cache (three if original image cache is also enabled):

```swift
let request = ImageRequest(url: url, processors: [
    ImageProcessor.Resize(size: imageView.bounds.size),
    ImageProcessor.CoreImageFilter(name: "CISepiaTone")
])
```

To avoid storing unwanted images, compose the processors, `ImageProcessor.Composition` is an easy way to do it.

> To save disk space see `ImageEncoders.ImageIO` and a new experimental `ImageEncoder._isHEIFPreferred` option for HEIF support.

<br/>

# Advanced Features

### Image Preheating

Prefetching images in advance can dramatically improve your app's user experience.

```swift
let preheater = ImagePreheater()
preheater.startPreheating(with: urls)

// Cancels all of the preheating tasks created for the given requests.
preheater.stopPreheating(with: urls)
```

Keep in mind that prefetching takes up users' data and puts extra pressure on CPU and memory. To reduce the CPU and memory usage, you have an option to choose only the disk cache as a prefetching destination:

```swift
// The preheater with `.diskCache` destination will skip image data decoding
// entirely to reduce CPU and memory usage. It will still load the image data
// and store it in disk caches to be used later.
let preheater = ImagePreheater(destination: .diskCache)
```

> On iOS, you can use [prefetching APIs](https://developer.apple.com/reference/uikit/uitableviewdatasourceprefetching) in combination with `ImagePreheater` to automate the process.

### Progressive Decoding

To enable progressive image decoding set `isProgressiveDecodingEnabled` configuration option to `true`.

<img align="right" width="360" alt="Progressive JPEG" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1567433/59148764-3af73c00-8a0d-11e9-9d49-ded2d509380a.png">

```swift
let pipeline = ImagePipeline {
    $0.isProgressiveDecodingEnabled = true
}
```

And that's it, the pipeline will automatically do the right thing and deliver the progressive scans via `progress` closure as they arrive:

```swift
let imageView = UIImageView()
let task = ImagePipeline.shared.loadImage(
    with: url,
    progress: { response, _, _ in
        if let response = response {
            imageView.image = response.image
        }
    },
    completion: { result in
        // Display the final image
    }
)
```

### Animated Images

To enable animated image support, set `ImagePipeline.Configuration.isAnimatedImageDataEnabled` to `true`. If enabled, Nuke will attach `animatedImageData` to the downloaded animated images. You going to need data to render the images.

There is no built-in way to render animated images, but there are multiple options available.

**Option 1**. Install [FLAnimatedImage Plugin](https://github.com/kean/Nuke-FLAnimatedImage-Plugin) and follow the instructions.

**Option 2**. Install [Gifu](https://github.com/kaishin/Gifu) directly. To configure Gifu to work with Nuke, all you need to do is add these lines in your project:

```swift
ImagePipeline.Configuration.isAnimatedImageDataEnabled = true

extension Gifu.GIFImageView {
    @objc open override func nuke_display(image: Image?) {
        prepareForReuse()
        if let data = image?.animatedImageData {
            animate(withGIFData: data)
        } else {
            self.image = image
        }
    }
}
```

You can now start using Gifu.GIFImageView:

```swift
let view = Gifu.GIFImageView()
Nuke.loadImage(with: URL(string: "http://.../cat.gif")!, into: view)
```

> `GIF` is not the most efficient format for transferring and displaying animated images. The current best practice is to [use short videos instead of GIFs](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/performance/optimizing-content-efficiency/replace-animated-gifs-with-video/) (e.g. `MP4`, `WebM`). There is a PoC available in the demo project which uses Nuke to load, cache and display an `MP4` video.

### WebP

WebP support is provided by [Nuke WebP Plugin](https://github.com/ryokosuge/Nuke-WebP-Plugin) built by [Ryo Kosuge](https://github.com/ryokosuge). Please follow the instructions from the repo.

### RxNuke

[RxNuke](https://github.com/kean/RxNuke) adds [RxSwift](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxSwift) extensions for Nuke and enables common use cases: [Going from low to high resolution](https://github.com/kean/RxNuke#going-from-low-to-high-resolution) | [Loading the first available image](https://github.com/kean/RxNuke#loading-the-first-available-image) | [Showing stale image while validating it](https://github.com/kean/RxNuke#showing-stale-image-while-validating-it) | [Load multiple images, display all at once](https://github.com/kean/RxNuke#load-multiple-images-display-all-at-once) | [Auto retry on failures](https://github.com/kean/RxNuke#auto-retry) | [And more](https://github.com/kean/RxNuke#use-cases)

To get a taste of what you can do with this extension, take a look at how easy it is to load the low resolution image first and then switch to high resolution:

```swift
let pipeline = ImagePipeline.shared
Observable.concat(pipeline.loadImage(with: lowResUrl).orEmpty,
                  pipeline.loadImage(with: highResUtl).orEmpty)
    .subscribe(onNext: { imageView.image = $0 })
    .disposed(by: disposeBag)
```

### Combine

[ImagePublisher](https://github.com/kean/ImagePublisher) adds Combine publishers for Nuke and, just like [RxNuke](https://github.com/kean/RxNuke), enables a variety of powerful use cases.

# Image Pipeline Overview

This section describes in detail what happens when you perform a call like `Nuke.loadImage(with: url, into: view)`.

> As a visual aid, use this [Block Diagram](https://github.com/kean/Nuke/blob/8.0/Documentation/Assets/image-pipeline.svg).

First, Nuke synchronously checks if the image is stored in the memory cache. If the image is not in memory, Nuke calls `pipeline.loadImage(with: request)`.

The pipeline first checks if the image or image data exists in any of its caches. It checks if the processed image exists in the memory cache, then if the processed image data exists in the custom data cache (disabled by default), then if the data cache contains the original image data. Only if there is no cached data, the pipeline will start loading the data. When the data is loaded the pipeline decodes it, applies the processors, and decompresses the image in the background.

### Data Loading and Caching

A `DataLoader` class uses [`URLSession`](https://developer.apple.com/reference/foundation/nsurlsession) to load image data. The data is cached on disk using [`URLCache`](https://developer.apple.com/reference/foundation/urlcache), which by default is initialized with memory capacity of 0 MB (only stores processed images in memory) and disk capacity of 150 MB.

> See [Image Caching Guide](https://kean.github.io/post/image-caching) to learn more about HTTP cache.

The `URLSession` class natively supports the following URL schemes: `data`, `file`, `ftp`, `http`, and `https`.

Most developers either implement their own networking layer or use a third-party framework. Nuke supports both of these workflows. You can integrate your custom networking layer by implementing `DataLoading` protocol.

> See [Third Party Libraries](https://github.com/kean/Nuke/blob/8.0/Documentation/Guides/Third%20Party%20Libraries.md#using-other-caching-libraries) guide to learn more. See also [Alamofire Plugin](https://github.com/kean/Nuke-Alamofire-Plugin).

### Resumable Downloads

If the data task is terminated (either because of a failure or a cancelation) and the image was partially loaded, the next load will resume where it was left off. Resumable downloads require the server to support [HTTP Range Requests](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Range_requests). Nuke supports both validators (`ETag` and `Last-Modified`). The resumable downloads are enabled by default.

### Memory Cache

The processed images are stored in a fast in-memory cache (`ImageCache`). It uses [LRU (least recently used)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cache_algorithms#Examples) replacement algorithm and has a limit of ~20% of available RAM. `ImageCache` automatically evicts images on memory warnings and removes a portion of its contents when the application enters background mode.

### Deduplication

The pipeline avoids doing any duplicated work when loading images. For example, let's take these two requests:

```swift
let url = URL(string: "http://example.com/image")
pipeline.loadImage(with: ImageRequest(url: url, processors: [
    ImageProcessor.Resize(size: CGSize(width: 44, height: 44)),
    ImageProcessor.GaussianBlur(radius: 8)
]))
pipeline.loadImage(with: ImageRequest(url: url, processors: [
    ImageProcessor.Resize(size: CGSize(width: 44, height: 44))
]))
```

Nuke will load the data only once, resize the image once and blur it also only once. There is no duplicated work done. The work only gets cancelled when all the registered requests are, and the priority is based on the highest priority of the registered requests.

> Deduplication can be disabled using `isDeduplicationEnabled` configuration option.

### Performance

<img align="right" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1567433/59372512-f7bc0680-8d47-11e9-865e-f739f013ad49.png" width="360"/>

Nuke is tuned to do as little work on the main thread as possible. It uses multiple optimization techniques to achieve that: reducing the number of allocations, reducing dynamic dispatch, CoW, etc.

Nuke is fully asynchronous and performs well under stress. `ImagePipeline` schedules its operations on dedicated queues. Each queue limits the number of concurrent tasks, respects the request priorities, and cancels the work as soon as possible. Under the extreme load, `ImagePipeline` will also rate limit the requests to prevent saturation of the underlying systems.

If you want to see how the system behaves, how long each operation takes, and how many are performed in parallel, enable the `isSignpostLoggingEnabled` option and use the `os_signpost` Instrument. For more information see [Apple Documentation: Logging](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/os/logging) and [WWDC 2018: Measuring Performance Using Logging](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2018/405/).
